									<p>With the rise of feminist movements in late twentieth-century Spain, the Catholic Church's <strong>hierarchy of gender norms</strong> was being challenged and met with <strong>resistance</strong>. Catholic feminists in Spain have made many contributions for the feminist movement, from their involvement in <strong>feminist theology</strong>, creation of <strong>religious material</strong> made for women, and maintaining of <strong>empowering spaces</strong> that foster <strong>dialogue</strong> amongst women in the Catholic Church.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Feminist Theology Movements</h2>
									<p>The <strong>Asociación de Teólogas Españolas</strong> (ATE) (founded in 1992) is an organization that promoted feminist theology in Spain. Its members developed theology <strong>focused on women’s experiences</strong> in history and religion as a counter to male centered doctrines. Biblical figures like <strong>Mary Magdalene</strong> were reinterpreted from a <strong>woman-centered perspective</strong>, changing her narrative to a <strong>disciple</strong> that witnessed Jesus’ resurrection instead of a sinner.</p>
									<p>Ohter Catholic feminist organizations such as <strong>Mujeres y Teología</strong> and the <strong>Forum of Studies on Women</strong> promoted equality within Catholic practices through <strong>grassroots (bottom up) initiatives</strong></p>
                                    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“[Mary Magdalene] had almost become the epitome of the female sinner (prostitute) […] It became urgent to read the Gospel with new eyes to recover the Magdalene’s image of a disciple of Jesus from the beginning, the first witness of His resurrection and … the voice for the voiceless” (Valiente).
									  </blockquote>
                                    <hr class="major" />

									<h2>Women-Centered Materials</h2>
									<p>Written by feminist theologians for Catholic women, the Asociación de Teólogas Españolas created <strong>prayer books</strong> that <strong>centered women’s personal experiences</strong> in religious reflection with themes like <strong>relationships</strong>, <strong>caregiving roles</strong>, and <strong>autonomy</strong>.</p>
									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										"For instance, their authors reflected on the personal relationships that they had forged as daughters, female friends, female co-workers, wives or mothers” (Valiente).
									  </blockquote>
                                    <p>The Forum of Studies on Women also created <strong>study booklets</strong> to support small groups of women in <strong>studying</strong> the Bible and Church teachings while <strong>addressing gender inequality</strong> within Catholicism. In addition, it promoted <strong>ecumenism</strong> and <strong>interfaith dialogue</strong> in an <strong>intersectional way</strong> that made the feminist movement impactful.</p>
                                    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										"In these groups, women work together to obtain a deeper knowledge of the Bible or the Catholic doctrine, reflect on how they live their religiosity or pray” (Valiente).
									  </blockquote>
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />

									<h2>Challenges from the Catholic Hierarchy</h2>
									<p>The Catholic hierarchy specifically in Spain has been <strong>persistently hostile</strong> toward feminist movements. Bishops have outright <strong>ignored demands</strong> for change, <strong>barred</strong> the feminist groups from Church activities, and <strong>removed</strong> feminists from <strong>Church spaces</strong>. This <strong>uncompromising stance</strong> has made policy changes seemingly impossible, with little to <strong>no chance</strong> for increased <strong>leadership roles</strong> for women in the Church. </p>
                                    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“The Church hierarchy in Spain has always displayed a contemptuous approach towards feminism, which has consisted of ignoring all feminist claims, including those made by Catholic feminist groups” (Valiente).
									  </blockquote>
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />

									<h2>Catholic Feminist Activists</h2>
									<p>Pilar Bellosillo was a Catholic feminist figure in Spain who <strong>founded the Forum of Studies on Women</strong>, through which she addressed the <strong>inequality of women</strong> within the Catholic Church. This organization created <strong>inclusive spaces</strong> for women in religious practices. Bellosillo also was the <strong>President of the World Union of Catholic Women’s Organizations</strong>, where she advocated for Catholic women <strong>globally</strong> for their inclusion in Church <strong>decision-making processes</strong>. During <strong>Vatican II</strong>, she was one of the <strong>few female auditors</strong> (women allowed to attend the Council’s sessions without voting rights). She <strong>pushed boundaries</strong> of what was <strong>traditionally accepted</strong> for women under Church authority.</p>
                                    <p>Teresa Forcades is a <strong>Catalan Benedictine nun</strong>, theologian, and doctor who became a key figure in Catholic feminism. She has critiqued the Church’s <strong>patriarchal structures </strong>and teachings, especially those in relation to <strong>women’s roles</strong> in the Church and <strong>sexual ethics</strong>. Forcades has advocated for greater inclusion of women within <strong>Church leadership</strong> even as far as the <strong>ordination of women</strong>. As a supporter of <strong>Catalan nationalism</strong> and social justice, her work shows a <strong>broader intersection</strong> of <strong>liberation</strong> theology and <strong>feminist</strong> theology.</p>
