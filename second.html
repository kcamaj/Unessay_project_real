									<p>In the <strong>late 1900s</strong>, Catholic feminism was on the rise and was initiated by the <strong>intersection</strong> of faith, class, and gender structures within Chilean society. The conservative and <strong>patriarchal hierarchy</strong> that defines the make up of the Catholic Church played a large role in the uprising of this movement and the many advocates for change, including the <strong>Liga de Damas Chilenas</strong>. The Liga de Damas Chilenas (beginning in <strong>1912</strong>) became a source for upper-class Chilean women to push for change and question the <strong>framework</strong> of their society. To get a broader understanding of Catholic Feminism in Chile, this section will cover the Liga de Damas Chilenas and the ways in which <strong>class</strong>, <strong>gender</strong>, and <strong>faith</strong> played a role in their achievements during the rise of feminism in response to Catholic social frameworks.</p>

									<h2>The Liga de Damas Chilenas</h2>
									<p>The Liga de Damas Chilenas was made up of <strong>upper-class</strong> Catholic Chilean women in order to address social issues pertaining to its well-educated and wealthy members. The organization was centered on <strong>charity</strong>, <strong>moral reform</strong>, and the maintaining of traditional <strong>conservative values</strong>. Led by <strong>Juan Enrique Concha Subercaseaux</strong>, the Liga de Damas Chilenas published their views on the  "Eco", a periodical in which they expressed their social/moral reforms as well as their goal in helping society through charity and moral teachings. Specifically, their charity work extended to supporting women and families that dealt with <strong>poverty</strong>. Their expressed moral views included the belief that women were the guardians of the home; in addition, they stressed that the majority of societal <strong>problems</strong> in existence at the time were results of the <strong>abandonment of family values</strong> by men who gave into alcoholism, for example, and women who lived consumerist lives of continuous spending.</p>
									
									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“Not surprisingly, the Liga and the men who spoke to it worried...about the moral collapse of the nation on working-class men who drank too much and abandoned their families and upper-class women who were spending too much money on dresses and frivolities” (Monteón).
									  </blockquote>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Class and Gender</h2>
									<p>Despite there charity for the poor, <strong>class privilege</strong> in the Liga was prominent, as its members believed themselves to be <strong>morally superior</strong> and therefore bestowed with a duty to <strong>uplift</strong> society as supposed perfectionists in morality. This created a <strong>conflict</strong> in the Liga's feminist ideals and class privelege. A danger to morality as seen repeatedly throughout their writings in "Eco" was <strong>lujo (luxury)</strong>. The increase in luxurious ways of living and spending was what the Liga believed to be the <strong>undermining</strong> of order both socially and morally. In addition, the rise in <strong>factory work</strong> amongst women threatened the traditional domestic roles once more.</p>
									
									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“...the dangers of lujo, what in the United States was called conspicuous consumption” <br>
										“The Liga expressed concern over upper-class women abandoning domestic service for the factories” (Monteón).
									  </blockquote>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Conservative Feminism</h2>
									<p>Due to the <strong>conservative</strong> nature of the Liga, their beliefs remained constrained under the traditional <strong>gender binary</strong> in which women followed household duties and assumed the role of <strong>caregives/mothers</strong>. They <strong>did not challenge</strong> patriarchal Church structures in a direct way; they focused in on <strong>moral/individual reform</strong> rather on broader social issues such as inequality.</p>
									
									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										"The Liga...raised issues about gender roles and class conflict, but these debates remained constrained within the conservative Catholic framework” (Monteón).
									  </blockquote>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Modern Influences</h2>
									<p>The Liga’s <strong>conservative feminism</strong> set the stage for later debates about women’s roles in the Church and society. They highlighted the tension between <strong>advocating</strong> for societal change while <strong>maintaining</strong> the <strong>privilege of the elite</strong>. This legacy shapes Chilean Catholic feminism and its <strong>intersectionality</strong> of class and gender.</p>

									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“The Liga’s concerns about morality and class continue to shape the broader conversation about gender and Catholicism in Chile”  <br>
“Her general presentation of Chile in this era owes a great deal to James Morris, whose book on the ‘social question’...continues to provide a guide to the elite views of working people in the early twentieth century” (Monteón).
