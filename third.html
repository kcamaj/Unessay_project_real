									<p>Kenyan women, especially nuns, have faced <strong>exclusion</strong> and mistreatment by the hierarchal Catholic Church since the <strong>colonial structures</strong> were first set in place. Yet, these women have used <strong>education</strong> and their <strong>agency</strong> as human beings to change their predefined roles within the Church despite the <strong>cultural</strong> and <strong>socio-economic barriers</strong> that come their way. Their efforts have successfully created <strong>spaces</strong> for women to feel <strong>safe</strong> and <strong>seen</strong> by their religious community.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Historical Context</h2>
									<p>Since the <strong>colonial era</strong> (1895 to 1963), the Catholic Church in Kenya was dominated by male clergy, who adhered to <strong>kyriarchal theology</strong> (in which male authority is emphasized). Women were left to fulfill their expectations of gender norms through <strong>caregiving</strong> and <strong>domestic duties</strong> within religious life. This included jobs such as <strong>teaching</strong> and <strong>nursing</strong> for Catholic institutions.</p>
									
									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“The religious are explicitly excluded from the Church’s hierarchical structure, which in itself is not the problem. The issue is that men and women live a religious life, but in reality, women who feel called by God...are stifled by the Church’s doctrinal teachings” (Eze).
									  </blockquote>

                                    <p>The <strong>continued exclusion</strong> of women from <strong>decision-making positions</strong> perpetuated the existence of barriers for Catholic women and nuns. The only roles Kenyan Catholic women could assume were <strong>nuns or lay ministry</strong> with no roles with any kind of <strong>hierarchical authority</strong>.</p>
									
                                    <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										“This...is based on ‘kyriarchal theology’ which can best be described as theology of the fathers, which is androcentric. On this basis, religious women are often constrained to have limited space within which they can minister in the Church." (Eze).
									  </blockquote>

									<h2>Resistance and Agency</h2>
									<p>By pursuing a <strong>higher education</strong>, Kenyan nuns were able to <strong>assert their presence</strong> within Church spaces and gain influence. Education allowed for women to advocate for themselves and gain <strong>recognition</strong> in Church ministries. In addition to education, their <strong>creation of safe spaces</strong> has made the Church safer and inclusive for women. These nuns have gained access to resources and established <strong>community programs</strong> to empower women and girls.</p>
									
									<blockquote style="text-align: center;">
										"Through personal agency and education, sisters have negotiated and constructed the Church’s space into a safe space” (Eze).
									  </blockquote>

									<h2>Experience of Sr. Prof. Anne Nasimiyu Wasike</h2>
                                    <p>As a Catholic religious sister from the Little Sisters of St. Francis, Sr. Prof. Anne pursued and completed <strong>doctoral studies in Systematic Theology</strong> in the United States. Her local bishops <strong>challenged her</strong> for this decision about her own education, to the point where they travelled to the United States for the <strong>sole purpose of discouraging her</strong>. In returning home she was received with a <strong>cold welcome</strong> and could not get a job at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa. When she was invited by the Catholic University in Nairobi to give a workshop on inculturation, she was <strong>undermined by the Bishop present</strong>, who asked a priest who studied the topic if she was correct. Despite her many achievements and doctoral experience, her superior deemed her to be <strong>untrustworthy</strong> with a lack of ability in the focus of her studies.</p>
		
                                      <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
                                        "...the value of the women is the value of the Church" (Eze).
                                        </blockquote>
                                    <p>Yet the <strong>lack of acceptance</strong> she experienced did not deter Sr. Prof. Anne from contributing to theology and <strong>representing the voices of women</strong>. By speaking up for women in this way, she has become a <strong>renowned professor</strong> and continues to write about <strong>inclusive theology</strong> and the <strong>intersection</strong> of faith and African culture.</p>
                                        <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
                                            "...women are not just custodians of fundamental values of the Church but also inventors of these values and therefore must be recognized for their worth" (Eze).
                                        </blockquote>
